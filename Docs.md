## Creating a package

Once the package is installed, you can use the commands in it, here is how to make one.

The top of the file must look like this;

```python
#["<package-name>", "package.<package-name>", ["command, command"]]
# made by <your name here>
```

then, to write a command, just write a function with the code you want to run, take this for example;

```python
#["echo", "package.echo", ["out"]]
# made by <Your name Here>

#Function name and command must be the same
def out(message):
    print(message)
```

From here you can run pretty much anything.


```python 
#["test", "package.test", ["hello"]]
#you can even do classes

class test:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hello = "World"

    def func(self):
        print(self.hello)

def hello(args):
    del args
    test = test()
    test.func()

```
